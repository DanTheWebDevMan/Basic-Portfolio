    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="assets/images/pic_DZ.jpg"/>
    <p>The name is Danniel, I sometimes go by Danny depending on my mood and I'm trying to change careers by learning a skill- web development. There's a demand for this role, the money is good, and I'm hungry to learn more about this.</p>
    <p>With these skills I hope I get the ability to work for myself, or have the ability to work remote due to the skills I've acquired through this bootcamp.</p>
    <p>On a more personal note, I like to the following on my spare time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Work out</li>
        <li>Try new places to eat</li>
        <li>Travel</li>
    </ul>
